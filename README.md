# MERN Coding Challenge

## Project Description
This coding challenge under i follow the MVC pattern. 
Initially, I encountered some issues with MongoDB, particularly with the advanced features.
However, I was able to resolve these issues using the Postman tool. 
For the frontend, I used Vite because it is faster than Create-React-App. 
The frontend part was relatively easy for me. 
To create Bar-Chart and Pie Chart, I used the `react-chartjs-2` dependency.
This coding challenge has been a very valuable learning experience for me.
Thank you.
